# Emotion Detection App

This is a simple **Emotion Detection** web app built using **Streamlit** for the user interface and a machine learning model trained on **Google Colab**. The app predicts emotions from text input and displays the result with a confidence score and probability distribution.

## Features
- Predicts the emotion of the entered text.
- Displays the predicted emotion with an emoji.
- Shows the probability distribution for other emotions in a pie chart.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For building the web app.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For the machine learning model.
- **Altair**: For visualizing the probability distribution in a pie chart.
- **Joblib**: To save and load the trained model.
- **Google Colab**: For training the model.
- **VS Code**: For running the Streamlit app locally.
